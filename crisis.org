** Abstract
We survey recent literature on the causes of the collapse in international trade during the 2008â€“2009 global recession.
We argue that the evidence points to the collapse in aggregate expenditure, concentrated on trade-intensive durable goods, as the main driver of the trade collapse.
Inventory adjustment likely amplified the impact of these expenditure changes on trade.
In addition, shocks to credit supply constrained export supply, further exacerbating the decline in trade.
Most evidence suggests that changes in trade policy did not play a large role.
** Introduction
1. Changes in real final expenditure were responsible for most of the collapse of international trade.
2. Financial shocks that disrupted export supply and impeded international transactions played a secondary role in explaining the decline of trade.
3. Changes in trade policy --- i.e., protectionism --- played essentially no role in explaining the trade collapse, at least in the aggregate.
** Stylized Facts
1. The trade collapse stands out relative to post-WWII experience in terms of its abruptness, magnitude, and synchronization across countries.
2. The trade collapse was asymmetric across sectors.
3. The trade collapse occurred almost entirely on the intensive margin of trade, whether measured at the sector or firm level.
4. The trade collapse mostly resulted from changes in the volume of trade, not price changes.
** Framework
*** Constant elasticity of substitution (CES) import demand
    \(d_{ij} = \frac{\left(\tau_{ij}p_i}{P_j}\right)^\sigmaD_j\),
    - \(d_{ij}\) is the aggregate real imports by country \(j\) from country \(i\),
    - \(p_i\) is the price at the factory gate of the good from country \(i\),
    - \(\tau_{ij}\) is an ad valorem cost of deliviring good s from the factory gate in country \(i\) to final purchasers in country j,
    - \(P_j\) is the aggregate price index for final expenditure in country \(j\), and
    - \(D_j\) is real aggregate expenditure by country \(j\).
    \(d_{ij}\)
    \(hat{d}_{ij} = - \sigma\left(\hat{p}_i-\hat{P}_j\right)-\hat{D}_j\)
    We refer to \(\hat{d}_ij\) as the CES-predicted change in imports.
    "This CES import demand equation immediately points to two reasons why trade collapsed."
    \(\omega\equiv\hat{m}_{ij}-\hat{d}_{ij} = \hat{m}_{ij} + \sigma\left(\hat{p}_i-\hat{P}_j\right)-\hat{D}_j\)
    We call \(\omega\) the trade wedge. The trade wedge measures the discrepancy between the model and data, serving as a model diagnostic.
In summary, we propose mapping explanations for the trade collapse into either (a) relative price changes or (b) changes in the trade wedge.
** The Composition of Expenditure Changes
*** Translating Aggregate Expenditure into Imports
**** Asymmetries in expenditure changes across sectors
**** Input linkages across sectors
**** Vertical specialization in trade.
**** Evidence on the Role of Expenditure Changes
** Amplification via Inventory Adjustments
** Financial Shocks and Exports
** Trade Policy
** Conclutions
*** Three main proximate causes and/or propagation mechanisms that account for the collapse of international trade
1. Compositional effects associated with changes in expenditure: 65-80%
2. Credit shocks: 15-20%
3. Inventory adjustments: up to 20%
4. Trade policy: 0%
